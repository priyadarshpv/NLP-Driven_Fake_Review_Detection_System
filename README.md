# **NLP-Driven Fake Review Detection System**  

## **Overview**  
This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to classify reviews as either *Computer Generated* or *Original*. Using a combination of text preprocessing techniques and machine learning, the system processes raw textual data, extracts meaningful features, and predicts review authenticity. This tool can be particularly valuable for e-commerce platforms and review aggregation websites to filter out fake reviews and maintain trustworthiness.  

## **Features**  
- Comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF vectorization**.  
- Classification using **Logistic Regression** for binary labels (`Computer Generated` or `Original`).  
- Interactive review prediction functionality via a custom Python function.  
- Easily extensible for integration with other machine learning models or datasets.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used contains textual reviews labeled as:  
- **CG (Computer Generated)**  
- **OR (Original)**  

Preprocessing steps included:  
- Dropping irrelevant columns (`category`).  
- Normalizing, tokenizing, and lemmatizing review text.  
- Converting the `label` column to binary format (`0` for CG, `1` for OR).  

## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-review-detection.git  
   cd fake-review-detection  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## **Usage**  
1. Load the dataset: Place your dataset file (`fake reviews dataset.csv`) in the appropriate directory.  
2. Run the script to preprocess the data and train the model.  
3. Use the `fake_pred()` function to classify individual reviews:  
   ```python  
   fake_pred(\"\"The wireless headphones offer superior sound quality...\")  
   ```  

## **Example Predictions**  
- Input:  
  ```  
  "The iPhone 14 delivers vibrant visuals and seamless performance..."  
  ```  
  Output:  
  ```  
  Computer Generated Review  
  ```  

- Input:  
  ```  
  "The camera quality on XYZ Mobile is fantastic for the price point."  
  ```  
  Output:  
  ```  
  Original Review  
  ```  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **NLTK** for text preprocessing.  
- **Scikit-learn** for feature extraction and model development.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for converting text into numerical features.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Extend to advanced models like **BERT** or **GPT** for contextual understanding.  
- Develop a web-based interface for real-time review classification.  
- Integrate additional datasets for improving model generalizability.
